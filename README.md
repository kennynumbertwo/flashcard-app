# Flashcard Application

Welcome to the beta version of my flashcard application.


## About

This is a full featured flashcard application I built with React and Firebase Firestore. The application allows individual users to create, edit and delete decks within their personal collection. The user can also track their knowledge through the mastery rating tracked on each run through a specific deck. On top of that, there are a large number of stock decks a user can choose from and add to their collection. I wrote Python web scrapers to collect and catalog all of the stock decks currently in the collection in the application.

## Features

* User authentication and login page provided through Firebase
* User created flashcard decks stored under My Collections page
* Stock flashcard decks allow you to test your knowledge on a variety of topics
* Stock flashcard decks can be added to the users collection and modified to their liking
* Track your deck mastery to keep track of how well you know the decks in your collection
* Desktop and mobile friendly

## Getting Started

1. Create an account with an email and password or through Gitbhub, Google or Facebook
2. *My Collections* will start off empty. Click the pencil icon at the bottom of the page to navigate to the *Edit Collections* page and create your first deck.
3. Once a deck has been created, navigate to the *Edit Cards* tab to start adding cards to the deck.
4. To run your newly created deck, navigate back to *My Collections* by clicking the button at the bottom of the page. 
5. Click *Start* on the deck you'd like to run. Be sure to click the stars to track your mastery for that deck.
6. *Stock Decks* can be found from the *My Collections* page under the *Stock Decks* tab.
7. The mastery rating for a stock deck cannot be tracked unless it is added to your collection. To add it to your collection, start the deck and click the thumbs up on the pop up asking if you'd like to add the deck to your collection.
